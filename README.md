A project of a very simple server I did for a university course.
User can register themselves and POST info about a location using JSON files, GET info of all added locations by users. For POST and GET there is simple user authentiaction.

I did not have time to include any additional features and I was not able to test the security of the code and as such it is vulnerable to attacks.
